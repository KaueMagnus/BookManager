# BookManager

**BookManager** is a Java console application for managing a book library using a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach. This project utilizes JDBC for database interaction and organizes the code into layers for easier maintenance and extensibility.

## Features

- **Add Book**: Allows you to add new books with title, author, and number of pages.
- **List Books**: Displays all books registered in the library.
- **Update Book**: Modifies the details of an existing book.
- **Delete Book**: Removes a book from the library.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **JDBC**
- **PostgreSQL** (or another relational database)
- **DBeaver**

## Project Structure

- **Model**: Contains classes representing the data structure (`Book`).
- **Repository**: Includes classes responsible for database interaction (`BookRepository`).
- **Service**: Implements business logic (`BookService`).
- **View**: Manages user interface (`LibraryMenu`).

## How to Run

1. **Database Configuration**: Set up your database and adjust the JDBC connection URL in the `DatabaseConnection` class.
2. **Compile and Run**: Compile and run the application using your preferred IDE or from the command line.
3. **Interaction**: Use the terminal menu to add, list, update, and delete books.

## Example Usage

Upon starting the application, you will be presented with a menu of options where you can choose to add, list, update, or delete books. The system will prompt for necessary information and perform the desired operations.
